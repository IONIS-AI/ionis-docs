# Credits

This project exists because of the amateur radio community. Every observation
in our dataset — 13.18 billion and counting — was generated by a ham radio
operator somewhere in the world, running a beacon, making a contact, or
submitting a log. Without them, there is no data. Without the data, there is
no IONIS.

**To every amateur radio operator who has ever transmitted a WSPR beacon,
worked a contest, appeared on the Reverse Beacon Network, or shown up on
PSK Reporter: thank you.**

## Data Sources

- **Joe Taylor, K1JT** — Creator of WSPR, WSJT, WSJT-X, and MAP65. Nobel Laureate
  (Physics, 1993). The WSPR protocol and software that generates the observations
  we study are his contributions to amateur radio.
- **WSPRNet** (wsprnet.org) — The community-operated database that collects and
  archives WSPR spot reports from operators worldwide.
- **Reverse Beacon Network** (reversebeacon.net) — N4ZR, PY1NB, VE3NEA, and
  the global network of CW/RTTY skimmer operators who contribute spots.
- **PSK Reporter** (pskreporter.info) — Created and operated by
  **Philip Gladstone, N1DQ**. The largest real-time amateur radio reception
  report network, with 27,000+ active monitors contributing millions of
  FT8/FT4/WSPR spots daily. The MQTT real-time feed that powers our
  `pskr-collector` is provided by **Tom Sevart, M0LTE** — making the
  full firehose of reception data available to the community.
- **CQ Contest Logs** — World Wide Radio Operators Foundation (WWROF)
- **ARRL Contest Logs** — American Radio Relay League
- **GFZ Potsdam** — Helmholtz Centre Potsdam, German Research Centre for
  Geosciences. Solar and geomagnetic indices (SSN, SFI, Kp).

## Giving Back

When we publish results, we share our findings with the data providers and the
amateur radio community — including the RBN community, who have asked that
researchers share their analysis back. We are happy to do so.
