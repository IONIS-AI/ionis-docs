# Credits

This project exists because of the amateur radio community. Every observation
in our dataset — 13.18 billion and counting — was generated by a ham radio
operator somewhere in the world, running a beacon, making a contact, or
submitting a log. Without them, there is no data. Without the data, there is
no IONIS.

**To every amateur radio operator who has ever transmitted a WSPR beacon,
worked a contest, appeared on the Reverse Beacon Network, or shown up on
PSK Reporter: thank you.**

## Data Sources

- **Joe Taylor, K1JT** — Creator of WSPR, WSJT, WSJT-X, and MAP65. Nobel Laureate
  (Physics, 1993). The WSPR protocol and software that generates the observations
  we study are his contributions to amateur radio.
- **[WSPRNet](https://wsprnet.org)** — The community-operated database that collects and
  archives WSPR spot reports from operators worldwide.
- **[Reverse Beacon Network](https://reversebeacon.net)** — N4ZR, PY1NB, VE3NEA, and
  the global network of CW/RTTY skimmer operators who contribute spots.
- **[PSK Reporter](https://pskreporter.info)** — Created and operated by
  **Philip Gladstone, N1DQ**. The largest real-time amateur radio reception
  report network, with 27,000+ active monitors contributing millions of
  FT8/FT4/WSPR spots daily. The MQTT real-time feed that powers our
  `pskr-collector` is provided by **Tom Sevart, M0LTE** — making the
  full firehose of reception data available to the community.

## Giving Back

When we publish results, we share our findings with the data providers and the
amateur radio community — including the RBN community, who have asked that
researchers share their analysis back. We are happy to do so.
